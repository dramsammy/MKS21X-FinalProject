# MKS21X-FinalProject

TEAM 41!--SCRABBLE--Oliver Ripps and Devin Ramsammy

GAME RULES AND INSTRUCTIONS!!!!!

Logs!!

1/3/19 - We both created all the java files and added in the basic framework of their instance varibales and methods. We started with the Pieces and Board files and went through coding and adding new methods as well as starting to create construtors.

1/4-6/19 - From friday through sunday(weekend's work), we spent a lot of time thinking critically about the function of our program and how we will need to adjust our original plan. After spending a lot of time figuring out how to print the board, we realized it would be most affective to have a pop up menu which we will adress after we finish the game mechanics. We also switched a lot of things behind the scenes including making every ArrayList into a 2D array for the board, reworking constructors to not take as many imputs, and creating accesor and modifier methods for Pieces.

1/7/19 - Oliver added a lot of manuel additions to the code, including programing the total pieces to start off with as well as the value assosiated with each one. We also changed the board constructor and set up the multipliers in the right place on the board. Devin worked on instance variables for each class, worked on player class, fixed dictionaries, fixed methods with player hand, setup word parsing, and worked on isvalidword boolean. Drew out a plan to continue working on the project

1/8/19 - Devin added some additions with the scoring methods in the Player class. Then we worked on the drawing mechanism for replacing the hands after a piece was played. We finalized the playing piece methods and worked on other instance variables for the game class. We finished the constructor and added name methods for the end of game and player. Oliver, in class, worked on functions to modify the board as well as creating a driver to test. He then went through each class we have been working on and "audited" them. This composed of debugging, deleting unneccesary functions, and making clear comments with purpose of functions and what we need to fix. LOT OF WORK DONE TODAY

1/9/18 - Today was a much less busy day. Oliver finished toString of the board and tested it. Overall we are fairly set for the basic parts of the game and now need to work with lanterna to create a physical image. Worked on adding imports for lanterna and testing basic terminal guis. Realized it would be best if we use screen. Fixed coords with some of the methods.

1/10/18 - In class, Oliver worked on the player functions of drawing pieces and Devin worked on figuring out how to use Laterna. Oliver took the night off to study for the APCS test tmr.

1/11-13/18 - Over the weekend, we did a lot of work to prepare for the demo on monday. On saturday,devin created the main for game with lanterna while Oliver polished off back end functions on friday. On sunday, Oliver worked on getting the board to print out properly with colors in one coordinate. He ran in to challenges with the color and new line. Ultimetely he had to split on \n and an inserted "exit key" to get it to the read the color correctly. After the board was up, both oliver and devin tried to add keys and fake score boards as well as the beggining of the turn mechanics to show for the demo.

1/14/18 - We both worked on the functionality of the game. Oliver edited the constructors and reconfigured the way players are initialized and constructed. He also fixed the hand and made it show up clearly with the position key under it. Devin worked on making the turn mechanic. He addded in being able to select postitions and having them show up. We also dealt with some minor formatting issues such as the color.
