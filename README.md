# MKS21X-FinalProject

TEAM 41!--SCRABBLE--Oliver Ripps and Devin Ramsammy

GAME RULES AND INSTRUCTIONS!!!!!

Logs!!
1/3/19 - We both created all the java files and added in the basic framework of their instance varibales and methods. We started with the Pieces and Board files and went through coding and adding new methods as well as starting to create construtors.

1/4-6/19 - From friday through sunday(weekend's work), we spent a lot of time thinking critically about the function of our program and how we will need to adjust our original plan. After spending a lot of time figuring out how to print the board, we realized it would be most affective to have a pop up menu which we will adress after we finish the game mechanics. We also switched a lot of things behind the scenes including making every ArrayList into a 2D array for the board, reworking constructors to not take as many imputs, and creating accesor and modifier methods for Pieces.

1/7/19 - Oliver added a lot of manuel additions to the code, including programing the total pieces to start off with as well as the value assosiated with each one. We also changed the board constructor and set up the multipliers in the right place on the board. Devin worked on instance variables for each class, worked on player class, fixed dictionaries, fixed methods with player hand, setup word parsing, and worked on isvalidword boolean. Drew out a plan to continue working on the project

1/8/19 - Devin added some additions with the scoring methods in the Player class. Then he worked on the drawing mechanism for replacing the hands after a piece was played. He finalized the playing piece methods and worked on other instance variables for the game class. He finished the constructor and added name methods for the end of game and player
